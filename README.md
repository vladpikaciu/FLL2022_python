# FLL2022 Python
Python programs used by the All for One team from Balti during the 2022 FLL competition.

  - 1 Main file called brazilia2022.py that executes all the other script at the press of the center button on the [ev3 robot](https://pybricks.com/ev3-micropython/examples/robot_educator_basic.html).
  - 4 files that contain the program for every run of the robot on the match table.
  - 1 Pikachu Image that is shown on the screen when the program is executed. (for fun)
